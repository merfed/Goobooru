# Goobooru

Goobooru is a booru much like Moebooru, except it's written in PHP on Laravel.

This is mostly for personal use, but feel free to use it and write any issues you encounter.

# Roadmap

This is for stuff that isn't obvious because there's currently nothing in the views to suggest it should be there.

* Bulk add comments of specific types.
* Color staff links as yellow.
